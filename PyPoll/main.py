#methodology
#open the file
#read the file
#read the third column [2] and store it as a list
#read that list to find the unique values
#create a list with the candidate list (unique values from column [2])
#count the number of times each name in the list occures in the column
#count the total number of rows
#create a dictionary with each candidates name, the % of the total votes they won, and their vote count
#print it out 
#create a txt files to print it out there
